## About me
I'm a *Full-stack developer* from Kyiv with 3+ years of experience.  <br/>
I have a Bachelor of Science in **computer engineering** and currently, I'm continuing to study to get my Master's degree at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in the same specialty. <br/>
In my studies and at my work I'm always trying to delve into the details and strive to perfection. I'm always eager to learn something new and improve my existing knowledge.
